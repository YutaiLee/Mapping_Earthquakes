# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.
### Summary
* Access GeoJSON data website [here](https://yutailee.github.io/Mapping_Earthquakes/)
* The map displays all earthquake data over the past 7 days and it also shows where all tectonic plates are located around the world.
* By clicking on one of the circles, that represents and earthquake, you can view the magnitude and the location of where the earthquake occurred.
* You can choose to toggle the map view from 3 different styles: Street View, Satellite View and Dark View.
* You can also choose to toggle the earthquake and tectonic plate data, they both are defaulted to appear.
